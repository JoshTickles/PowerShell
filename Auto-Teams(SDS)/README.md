This is a script collection to pull infromation from KAMAR, splice it up, and then generate CSVs for user import. 
Setup to work for MS-Teams deployments via SDS, but can be modified for anything.
<br>

**REQUIRED** - 
You need to have built a KAMAR Directory service to pull the required data. This is done by some simple PHP that dumps information to JSON. The JSON is then parsed by the script to generate the CSVs.

If you need to build a dir service, let me know or I can upload one.
